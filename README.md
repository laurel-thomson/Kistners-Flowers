# Kistner's Flowers

This is a simple website mock-up created for a Web Development course at Kansas State University.  It's a redesign of a website for a
Kistner's Flowers, a floral shop located in Manhattan, KS (see the <a href="https://www.kistnersflowers.com">original website</a>).
I redesigned the website's frontend using plain HTML and CSS.  I used node.js to create a simple server that serves a random sampling of
floral arrangements from a SQLite3 database.  Only the main page of the website is completed - the navigation consists of dummy links.
